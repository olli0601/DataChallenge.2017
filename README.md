# Data Challenge 2017 (MSc in Statistics, Imperial): mitigating epidemic disasters 	
 
### Background
[Stats Section](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/statistics)

The [West African Ebola
virus epidemic](http://apps.who.int/ebola/our-work/achievements) was the most
widespread outbreak of Ebola virus disease in history, with disastrous impact on
local populations, and entire countries. Other recent examples of major
infectious disease outbreaks are the [2015-2016 Zika
epidemic](http://www.who.int/emergencies/zika-virus/en/), and the
[MERS-coronavirus epidemic](http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/).

In response, the World Health Organization is characterising the risk of member
states to infectious disease threads. The primary aims are to prioritize
resources for epidemic prevention, early detection, and control by evaluating
areas that are most in need of resources as well as predicting the impact of
infectious disease threats  

### Primary objective
With these aims in mind, records of over 20,000 large-scale disasters have
been digitised. For the 2017 Data Challenge, epidemic outbreak counts are
available from 66 countries for 5 years, 2010 to 2014.

Your primary objective is to predict the number of epidemic disasters in the
same countries in the years 2015 and 2016.  

### Why we care
Scientifically, we are interested in identifying and understanding the interplay
of factors that are predictive of epidemic disasters at a country level. 

### Open data
To model vulnerability, the Word Health Organization is collecting data on a
countries' capacity to respond to major public health crises. The IHR data set
contains records of 11 capacity indicators per country for 6 years, 2010 to
2016, which could be used to inform a predictive model of epidemic disasters in
2015 and 2016.     

Some entries are missing, that's the first challenge. 

The World Bank have also made other large data sets, that
describe the wealth and health of countries, openly available. There is no
reason why you should limit yourself to the IHR data set in predicting
country-level risk of major epidemic disease outbreaks. For this year's Data
Challenge, we prepared for you several data sets, bringing the number of
potential predictors to 500. This is where the challenge starts to be fun.  

Combine the data, explore it, and see what is worth to include in your
predictive model. 

### Getting started
Please follow the HowTo guides in the green project bar at the top of the page
for further help. Good luck and we hope you enjoy the challenge!
